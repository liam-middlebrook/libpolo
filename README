==libpolo==

libpolo is a lightweight graphics, network and sound library for educational environments.

It is aimed towards students learning the C and C++ language, and is very suitable for high school and first-year university courses. Its functionality is built around the GLUT library. It provides a streamlined interface, also allowing full access to the OpenGL API. A feature list:

* 2D primitives (point, line, rect, quad, triangle, circle and a rounded rect)
* pen stroke and solid/gradient/texture fill for all primitives
* texture uploading from BMP files (RGB, RGBA formats)
* simple mouse and keyboard handling
* RGB and HSV color spaces

The network module supports unlimited TCP/IP connections, both in client and server mode.

The sound module is capable of playing back WAV, AIFF and OGG files.

It is cross-platform, and works under Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.

It is very easy to integrate in a project. Just install and include <polo/polo.h>. For libpolonet, include <polo/polonet.h>. For libpolosnd, include <polo/polosnd.h>.
