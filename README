==libpolo==

libpolo is a lightweight graphics library for educational environments.

It is aimed towards students learning the C and C++ language, and very suitable
for high school and first-year university courses.

It is built as a simple wrapper around the GLUT library, providing a very
streamlined interface, that can be expanded with full set of OpenGL calls.

It is cross-platform, and works under Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.

It is very easy to integrate in a project. Just add polo.c and polo.h in your
project, and link with the GLUT library.
