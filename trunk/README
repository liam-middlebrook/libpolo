==libpolo==

libpolo is a lightweight graphics, network and sound library for educational environments.

It is aimed towards students learning the C and C++ language, and is very suitable for high school and first-year university courses. Its functionality is built around the GLUT library, providing a streamlined interface and full access to OpenGL. A feature list:

* 2D primitives (point, line, rect, quad, triangle, circle and a rounded rect)
* pen stroke and solid/gradient/texture fill for all primitives
* texture uploading from BMP files (RGB, RGBA formats)
* simple mouse and keyboard handling
* RGB and HSV color spaces

The network module supports unlimited TCP/IP connections, both in client and server mode.

The sound module is capable of playing back WAV, AIFF and OGG files.

It is cross-platform, and works under Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.

It is very easy to integrate in a project. Just add polo.c and polo.h in your project, and link with the GLUT library.

For libpolonet, add polonet.c and polonet.h. For libpolosnd, add polosnd.c and polosnd.h.
