==libpolo==

libpolo is a lightweight graphics library for educational environments.

It is aimed towards students learning the C and C++ language, and is very suitable for high school and first-year university courses. It is built as a simple wrapper around the GLUT library, providing a streamlined interface and full access to OpenGL. Its features are:

* 2D primitives (point, line, rect, quad, triangle, circle and a rounded rect)
* pen stroke and solid/gradient fill for all primitives
* texture uploading from BMP files (RGB, RGBA formats)
* simple mouse and keyboard handling
* RGB and HSV color spaces

It is cross-platform, and works under Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.

It is very easy to integrate in a project. Just add polo.c and polo.h in your project, and link with the GLUT library.
